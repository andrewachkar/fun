# Fun

This is a collection a IPython Notebooks containing functional solutions to various programming challenges I found interesting. This is primarily for fun! 

All code is free to use and provided for learning purposes. Enjoy!


## Summary of Notebooks

1. Codility Lessons: algorithms that perform within specified time and space complexity
2. Extreme Value Distribution: a fun statistics question  
3. HackerRank: a series of warm-up style problems of varying difficulty
4. Misc Challenges: other challenges I've encountered 
5. Unfair Dice: a combinatorics problem I found interesting from check.io 


## Dependencies

All code has been tested in Python 3.4. It should be backwards compatible with Python 2.7, but has not been tested for this case.
